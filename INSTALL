Install schemepy is simple -- just copy the schemepy sub-directory
into your python site-packages directory. Under Linux, you can just
run `make install' to copy it to 

  /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/

Under Windows, you might want to manually copy it to

  C:\Python25\Lib\site-packages

or where you installed Python.
