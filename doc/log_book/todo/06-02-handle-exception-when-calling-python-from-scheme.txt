Handle exception when calling Python from scheme
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Both Scheme and Python has exception system. Currently, the exception
is only handled when calling Scheme from Python. But the behavior is
still undefined when a Scheme code calls a Python function which then
raises an exception.

Define the behavior of this problem and write code to handle this.
